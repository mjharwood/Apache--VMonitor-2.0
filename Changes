=over 

=item 2.04 - dev

Update to match the API changes in MP2 RC5 and above



=item 2.03 - Fri Mar 18 15:26:11 EST 2005

use %Apache::VMonitor::longflags long status lookup table, using the
values returned by status() in the string context. So we always give
the right value (previously we were looking up by a hardcoded index,
which might have been incorrect if new entries were added in the
scoreboard, but not at the end).

support new scoreboard status flags added in Apache 2.0

Elapsed and LastReq fields are now working properly, but for Apache
2.x users: Apache 2.0.53 or higher is required.



=item 2.02 - Fri Jan 21 17:07:53 EST 2005

Apache::Scoreboard 0.12 added the vhost accessor, so use it in the
presentation.



=item 2.01 - Sun Oct 31 16:09:07 EST 2004

sync API changes with mp1.99_15

in the single process mode view sort 'Memory Maps' and 'Loaded Libs
Sizes' by filename

drop 5.005 support. It's too much of a hassle. version 0.08 is
available for those who are stuck with 5.005.



=item 2.0 - Mon Dec 22 12:57:00 PST 2003

A complete rewrite of the previous generation to use Template Toolkit,
be subclassable and support mod_perl 1st and 2nd generations.
